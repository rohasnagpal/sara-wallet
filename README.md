## 🚀 Getting Started

Sara runs locally on your laptop. The frontend is a single HTML app; the backend is a Python FastAPI server.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohasnagpal/sara-wallet.git
cd sara-wallet/backend
```

### 2. Create a Python virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure your environment

Create a `.env` file in the repo root:

```bash
cd ..
touch .env
```

Example `.env`:

```env
LLM_PROVIDER=groq
LLM_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./sara.db

SARA_MASTER_KEY=your_wallet_passphrase_or_derived_key
```

> **`SARA_MASTER_KEY`** protects your locally stored private keys. You can use a normal passphrase in Settings — Sara derives the actual encryption key from it.  
> ⚠️ If you reset this key, existing encrypted wallets cannot be decrypted unless you restore the original key or re-import the wallets.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Then open your browser at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 6. Add your API keys

Open Sara in your browser, go to **Settings**, and add your preferred AI provider key.

**AI providers:**

```env
GROQ_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
XAI_API_KEY
GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

**Optional — market data & RPC endpoints:**

```env
COINGECKO_API_KEY
ALCHEMY_API_KEY
HELIUS_RPC
ETH_RPC
ARB_RPC
BASE_RPC
POLY_RPC
OP_RPC
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Sara is designed as a local-first wallet and AI assistant.

```

### Frontend

The frontend lives in `index.html`. It provides the wallet UI, chat interface, settings screen, address book, portfolio views, and local interaction flows. It communicates with the backend through local API routes under `/api/*`.

### Backend

The backend is a FastAPI app in `backend/main.py`. It handles:

- Wallet creation and import
- Encrypted private key storage
- Address book entries
- Chat commands
- Transaction preparation and confirmation
- Market data requests
- AI provider integration
- Local SQLite persistence

### Database

Sara uses SQLite by default at `backend/sara.db`. The main tables are `wallets`, `address_book`, `transactions`, `chat_messages`, and `config`.

### Wallet Encryption

Private keys are encrypted before being stored in SQLite. The encryption key is derived from `SARA_MASTER_KEY`, stored locally in `.env` or configured through Settings. **Private keys never leave your laptop.**

### AI Layer

Sara uses [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) to connect to different AI providers through one interface. The AI layer lives in `backend/app/llm/`.

Supported providers: **Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Gemini, Ollama**, and Cloudflare-compatible models.

### Chain Layer

Chain-specific logic lives in `backend/app/chains/`. Current modules cover:

- EVM chains — Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism
- Solana

Transaction tools are kept separate from chat handling so wallet actions can be validated before execution.

### Tool Layer

Sara's tools live in `backend/app/tools/`, organized into:

- Wallet tools
- Market data tools
- Name resolution tools
- Trading integrations
- Prediction market helpers

The chat interface routes user messages into these tools when a command can be handled deterministically.

## 🔒 Security Philosophy

Sara is built on a simple principle:

> **Your keys never leave your machine.**

- Private keys are encrypted and stored locally
- No telemetry, no cloud sync, no external key custody
- Open source — read every line, audit everything
- You own your wallet code
